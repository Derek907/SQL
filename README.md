# SQL
## SQL Portfolio

Hello, welcome to my SQL portfolio!

Here I will be providing examples of **SQL** code I have written. This portfolio will serve as a collection of knowledge for me and a demostration of how I have improved. I encourage you to look around and explore my projects, as well as if you have any feedback on improving my code for either readability or efficiency please let me know.

Thank you for taking the time to check out my portfolio!

Derek
