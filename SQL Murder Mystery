	/* Annabel Miller witness testimony : "I saw the murder happen,

/* Using the testimonies provided we can see that Jeremy Bowers is the murderer and is present in both testimonies.

/*using a 'where' clause and then a series of 'and' clauses we can filter out all other entries by using Jeremy's testimony.
Upon using these filters we discover the mastermind behind the murder and find that her name is Miranda Priestly!
She hired Jeremy Bowers to murder another person. Case closed!*/
